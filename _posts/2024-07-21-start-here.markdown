I’m Eric, a Storage Systems Administrator with one of the national high-performance computing facilities in Australia, that arguably is a type of community cloud provider. I’m currently completing my Masters of Cloud Computing and Virtualisation. For my ITC571 capstone research project, I’ve chosen a topic that has become of interest both at work within the area of research computing and in the realm of cloud computing: data security.

Specifically, I’ve chosen to look at how one could use transparent file encryption (or cryptography) to provide a level of data security for a research project handling sensitive datasets-this could be clinical biomedical data or something that is commercially encumbered. While encryption at rest is already a mostly solved problem in the realm of IT, it seems when it comes to research computing encryption is either an extra hurdle that a research group may not be equipped to handle, and if done incorrectly can have an impact on performance- or worse, set the project back if keys are lost, and with it data.
